+ **let, const, var**
  + const is immutable. 
  + we are not allowed to declare emply const variables
  + as a good practice, by default use ***const*** and use ***let*** when you are sure that you will assign a value to it later.
  + ***var*** is an old way. pretty much same as let


+ **Basic Operations**

    + ***2 ** 3*** means 2 to the power of 3
  + ***+*** is also used for concatenations
  + ***typeof*** operator give type of a value. ``` console.log(typeof firstName)```
  + Assignment Operator: ***=***
    + ``x += 10   // x= x + 10`` 
    + ``x++  // x= x + 1`` 
  + Comparison Operators:  >, <, >=, <=
